# Flappy flint  
A game inspired by flappy bird featuring my dog named Flint.  

Many things to do still:  
* Create sprites for the dog (Flint)  
    - Need to add sprites for hurdles and add a background  
    - I will be comissioning the help of my wife (Jenn) for artwork
* Create event handling for modifying player's velocity  
    - Based on keyboard input  
* Add jump support  
    - Add gravity 
* Determine how to make background slide  
* Add counter for successful jumps  
* Add collision between player and object  
    - Game over  
* Think about Game/RenderWindow interaction  
    - Currently RenderWindow is responsible for rednering a SDL_Texture, but it might be nice to have something like a TextureManager that the game would hold onto
* And much more!
